# Is Bitcoin Under Theoretical And Empirical Aspects Money?

This repository was created on 28.04.2023 and it serves the documentation of the empirical investigation of Bitcoin's money functions.

I will look into the three classical money functions which are (a) medium of exchange, (b) store of value, (c) unit of account.
For this I will look at statistical facts and try to determine what are the drivers of each function. 
- For (a) the dependent variable will be the price of Bitcoin. 
- For (b) the dependent variable will be the rolling 30-days-volatility of Bitcoin.
- For (c)

For data manipulation and data cleaning I will use Python. For statistical regressions I will use R.
